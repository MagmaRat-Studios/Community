# Personal Profiles

Here is the area to request a personal profile, follow the guidelines below, and you'll be sure to get a profile soon!

## Steps to getting a profile

First thing to note before we move on is that there are **_no profile settings_** which means any changes you want to make must be submitted through a pull request to this specifc repository.

We know it's very inconvient but it's all we can do at the moment, and it helps keep the community secure and safe!

Alright on to the steps now.

1. Follow this template:

* Display Name For the profile (choose your real name if you wish)
* Links you would like to provide (**optional**)
* A profile picture (**optional**)
* A profile banner (**optional**)
* Featured content; Videos, Images, etc. (**optional**) (You must get a complete and confirmed pull request for your content before you can request this content)
* Ads (**optional**) (You require an accepted ads request for this option)
* Bio (**optional but suggested**)
* Contact information (**optional**)

2. Submit a pull request to add this to the [personal profiles](https://github.com/MagmaRat-Studios/Community/tree/main/profile/personal%20profiles) repository
3. We will review your pull request and if all goes well we'll put it through!
   * We can take up to 10 DAYS for a request to go through, if nothing happens after that, submit another pull request and we'll try and get back to you sooner.

And that's all! 
### Note

If you have a premade HTML/CSS/JS profile page made up and it requires no other dependencies and can be run simply by opening the HTML file in a browser (All browsers
must be supported) then you can submit that instead and we will review it and then accept the pull request if it complies and is acceptable.
