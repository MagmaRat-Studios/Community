### What is this repository for?

The Community repository is for anyone in our communities to upload, share, and find content.

* Why does MagmaRat Studios Need this?

MagmaRat Studios has another site called [Medieval Business](https://medievalbus.app.vtxhub.com) that is a brand and copyrighted content site that is FOR our community.
The Medieval Business site is also used as the home for our animated series with the same name (Medieval Business).

As we don't allow uploads or changes to our [main site](http://magmarat.com) unless done by an administrator or developer of ours, we use this community site to safely,
and closely view and monitor what people want to upload and change.

* There's no login? How do I access my profile settings?

Remember to read the information provided in the [Main Profile](https://github.com/MagmaRat-Studios/Community/tree/main/profile) page.
